# Nexo Programming Language

Nexo is a modern, high-performance programming language designed to combine the power of systems languages like C++ with a cleaner and more readable syntax.

## Goals

The goal of Nexo is to be:

- Fast to compile
- Native-performance
- Easy to read and write
- Built from scratch

## Example

```nexo
fn main() {
    print("Hello, Nexo!");
}
```

## Planned Features

- Native Windows binaries
- Static typing with inference
- Simple and expressive syntax
- No garbage collector
- Fast compiler
- Clean error messages
